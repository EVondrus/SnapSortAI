## Project Overview

A client in e-commerce seeks a machine learning solution to automate product image categorization, currently performed manually. This automation will bring several benefits, including:
* Increased efficiency in product categorization
* Improved accuracy in product classification 
* Reduced manual labor and time 

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 categories, and the goal is to automate categorization with a scalable model for future use.

---

## Dataset Content

- **Source**: CIFAR-10 dataset from Kaggle.
- **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels in RGB format.
- **Image Uniformity**: Images within each category are not perfectly uniform. For example, there is a significant variation in backgrounds, angles, and lighting conditions within each class. This presented challenges for the model in recognizing consistent features, which is crucial for applying data science principles to image classification.
- **Subset:** A subset of 5,000 images was selected for training, testing, and validation due to limitations in storage and processing time for efficient deployment.

  This subset is split as follows:
  - **Train set:** 70% of the images (350 per class).
  - **Validation set:** 10% of the images (50 per class).
  - **Test set:** 20% of the images (100 per class).

- **Categories**: 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, frogs).

This subset balances training efficiency and performance while adhering to GitHub's file size limits. This analysis provides critical insights into the structure and characteristics of the CIFAR-10 dataset

## Hypothesis and Validation Process

### Hypothesis 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Hypothesis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CIFAR-10 dataset will reveal patterns and potential challenges, including class imbalances and image quality issues, which will guide preprocessing steps and model development.
* **Validation Method:** Conduct EDA on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Visualize the class distribution (e.g., with bar charts), explore the range of image sizes, and examine sample images for quality.
* **Result:**  EDA confirmed the hypothesis. It helped identify potential class imbalances and image quality issues, informing preprocessing steps and influencing the model's architecture and training strategy. 

### Hypothesis 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

* **Hypothesis:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) model will achieve at least 70% classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **Validation Method:** Train a CNN model using a dataset split into training, validation, and test sets. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using accuracy as the primary metric.
* **Result:** The final model (v7) achieved a test accuracy of approximately 71.20%.  The hypothesis is confirmed.

### Hypothesis 3: Data Augmentation

* **Hypothesis:** Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and shearing, will significantly enhance the model's accuracy and generalization ability.
* **Validation Method:**  Compare the performance of models trained with and without data augmentation. Analyze the confusion matrix and classification report for each model to assess the impact of data augmentation.
* **Result:** The final model (v7) incorporated data augmentation and achieved a significant improvement in test accuracy (e.g., from 62.60% in v5 to 71.20% in v7).  This confirms the hypothesis that data augmentation is crucial for improving model accuracy and generalization.

### Hypothesis 4: Model Optimization

* **Hypothesis:** Optimizing the model architecture and hyperparameters will further enhance the model's performance.
* **Validation Method:** Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., adding more layers, using pre-trained models) and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, regularization strength) to find the best combination for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **Result:** The final model (v7) incorporated a more complex architecture with three convolutional layers, batch normalization, and max pooling.  Hyperparameters were fine-tuned through multiple training iterations, including learning rate reduction and early stopping.  This optimization process contributed to the model achieving over 70% accuracy. The hypothesis is confirmed. 

## Validation Process

### Accuracy

- **Overall Model Correctness**: The primary validation metric used for this model is accuracy, which measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

### Model Evaluation

In addition to accuracy, the model's performance was evaluated using:

*   **Confusion Matrix:** A visual representation of the model's classification performance across all categories. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class.
*   **Classification Report:** This report provides a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance for each class, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Does exist in the ModelAndEvaluation notebook.

### Future Considerations

While the current validation focuses on accuracy, incorporating additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score on the dahboard could provide deeper insights into model performance for the stakeholders:

- **Precision**: Indicates the correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures how well the model identifies true positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall into a single metric, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

Implementing these metrics in future iterations will enhance the model evaluation and help guide improvements.

### Success Metrics

- **Target Accuracy**: At least 70% accuracy on the test set.
- **Data Augmentation Impact**: Expect at least a 5% improvement in accuracy.

### Implications

Validating these hypotheses will confirm the efficacy of combining CNNs with advanced techniques and guide future model improvements.

### Model Success

The final model (v7) successfully met the business requirements of achieving at least 70% accuracy on the test set. 

## Conclusions 

The final model (v7) successfully met the business criteria of 70% accuracy! 

Through a process of model evolution, involving architecture adjustments and data augmentation, the final model (v7) achieved the desired 70% accuracy.  The confusion matrix and classification report indicate that the model is performing well for some categories but struggles with others.  To further improve performance, the model's ability to differentiate between visually similar categories should be addressed.  

**Next Steps:**

- **Data Augmentation:** Explore more advanced augmentation techniques (e.g., color shifting, blurring) to create even greater variations in training data.
- **Model Architecture:** Research more sophisticated architectures, such as ResNet or VGG, for potentially higher accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Conduct more systematic hyperparameter tuning to optimize model settings.
- **Class Weights:**  Investigate the use of class weights to improve the model's performance on classes that are difficult to classify.

## Unfixed Bugs


### Bug Report: `StreamlitAPIException` - `set_page_config()` Issue

**Description:**
The following error occurs intermittently when launching the app:
- StreamlitAPIException: set_page_config() can only be called once per app, and must be called as the first Streamlit command in your script
  - This exception appears even though the script is configured according to the documentation. The issue seems to arise occasionally upon entering the app, and clearing the cache and rerunning it resolves the problem temporarily.

- File "/app/app.py", line 11, in <module> app = MultiPage(app_name="SnapSort AI") # Create an instance of the app File "/app/app_pages/multipage.py", line 24, in init st.set_page_config(

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run the app from the main entry point.
2. Occasionally, the `StreamlitAPIException` is raised.
3. Clear the cache and rerun the app navigate to summary page; the error disappears temporarily.

**Expected Behavior:**
The app should run without errors, with `st.set_page_config()` being executed correctly as the first Streamlit command.

**Investigation:**
- The `set_page_config()` function is confirmed to be called as the first command in the script, as per the Streamlit documentation.
- The error seems to occur sporadically, possibly due to caching issues or how the script is being loaded.

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Clearing the cache and rerunning the app temporarily resolves the issue, but this is not an ideal long-term solution.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Double-check that no other `set_page_config()` calls are being made elsewhere in the script or other modules.
- Ensure that no dependencies or async operations are delaying the execution of `set_page_config()` as the first command.
- Review the settings and Streamlit documentation for any caching-related configurations that might affect script execution order.

FIX: Add set_app_config to app.py. Still the page needs a reload every now and then and I seem to not be able to find the problem.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

### Issues

- During development, several compatibility challenges were encountered due to changes in library versions and syntax updates.
- These issues included dependency conflicts between different libraries, which often led to errors.
- To resolve this, I opted to use the requirements document from the CI Malaria Detector walkthrough project.
- This ensured the correct versions of libraries and dependencies were installed, providing a stable and compatible environment for the project.
- Heroku Issues - When I tried to deploy the working version of the Streamlit app on Heroku, there were issues with the size of the repo. I added to .slugignore the list of directories that weren't necessary for the execution of the app, but the slug file is still over the limit size and can slow down the deployment or lead to a failure due to Heroku's slug size limit."

### Fixed bugs

#### Bug Report: Incorrect Folder for `image_shape.pkl`

**Summary**:  
The initial deployment of the SnapSort AI application encountered issues due to referencing the incorrect folder for the `image_shape.pkl` file. This mistake prevented the model from functioning correctly.

**Details**:  
- **Issue**: The project was deployed using the wrong folder path for `image_shape.pkl`. The incorrect folder used was `v7`, while the correct folder should have been `v1`.
- **Impact**: Due to this error, the model failed to load, leading to overall malfunction.
- **Branch Correction**: The issue has been addressed in a new branch [corrected-version](https://github.com/EVondrus/SnapSortAI/tree/corrected-version).
- **Repository Update**: The project has been cloned into a new repository with the corrected versions: [SnapSortAI-corrected](https://github.com/EVondrus/SnapSortAI-corrected).
- **Deployment**: The corrected version has been successfully deployed to a new Heroku app: [SnapSort AI - One](https://snapsortai-one-d41485f6eb00.herokuapp.com/).

FIX: Added correct path to image_shape.pkl in v1
