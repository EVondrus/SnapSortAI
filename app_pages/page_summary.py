        This project is a data science and machine learning initiative aimed
        at automating image categorization for e-commerce.
        The core objective is to classify product images into
        one of 10 predefined categories using a machine learning model.
        The application is built with a Streamlit Dashboard, enabling users
        (such as e-commerce managers and product analysts) to upload images
        and receive instant categorizations with detailed reports.

        The dashboard features comprehensive data analysis,
        insights into model performance, and real-time classification results.
        It also provides an overview of the hypotheses tested
        and the performance metrics evaluated.

        The project is optimized for efficiency, with considerations for
        minimizing resource usage during model inference and data handling.

        - **Source**:[CIFAR-10 dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cifar-10).
        - **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels in RGB format.
        - **Image Uniformity**: Images within each category are not perfectly uniform. 
        - **Subset**: 5,000 images for training (70% train, 10% validation, 20% test). 
        - **Categories**: 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, frogs).

        This subset balances training efficiency and performance while adhering to GitHub's file size limits.

        1. **Dataset Analysis**:
        - Analyze the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand image distribution, patterns, and potential challenges, such as class imbalance.
        - This will inform preprocessing and model development to ensure accurate and robust image classification. 

        2. **Model Development**:
        - Develop a machine learning model to classify images into 10 categories, aiming to automate the categorization process and improve accuracy.
        - The model should be scalable and efficient for future use. 

        3. **Performance Evaluation**:
        - Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and processing speed to ensure practical application and identify areas for further improvement.
        - The model should achieve a minimum of 70% accuracy on the test set.
